CPU and OpenCL/GPU mining for Keccak (SHA-3)
Automatically can configure itself to failover to solo mining and local block submission when Bitcoin Core is running
Support for getblocktemplate decentralized mining protocol (no proxy needed!)
Builtin stratum and getwork proxy server
Very low overhead free C code for Linux and Windows with very low CPU usage
Integrated overclocking and fan control (including automatic adjustment, if configured)
Heavily threaded code hands out work retrieval and work submission to separate threads to not hinder devices working
Caching of submissions during transient network outages
Preemptive generation of work prior to completion of current work
Automatically detects failing pools and disables them
Multi-device support (all or discrete selection)
Summarised and discrete device data statistics of requests, accepts, rejects, hw errors, efficiency and utility
Watchdog thread to restart idle threads but not crash machine if they don’t respond
Summary displayed when quitting
Supports multiple pools with multiple intelligent failover mechanisms
On the fly menu based management of most settings
Trickling of extra work to backup pools if primary pool is responding but slow
On the fly enabling/disable/restarting of devices
Device temperature monitoring (for devices that support it)
Reuses persistent connections when possible
RPC interface for remote control
Ability to cope with slow routers
